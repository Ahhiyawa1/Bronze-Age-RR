"Rome.Override.IMPERIAL_CAMPAIGN_CARTHAGE_DESCR"                           = "\"From Africa always something new.\" – Aristoteles/Plinius the Elder\n\nPhoenicia. A small, but rich land in the East, home of our ancestors. More than half a millennium ago (between 825 and 813 BC), a little expedition from Tyros set out to found a colony in the West. Our records don't tell if they were searching for precious metals, or if the population of the country was becoming too large to feed, or if it was just the will of the gods that led them to the rocky shores of North Africa. But in any case, they founded our wonderful city Carthage. In the space of only a few decades, we became the lords of the North African coast and began to establish colonies of our own on Sardinia and along the western coast. Shortly before the Greeks began to settle Sicily, we built trade outposts on that island as well and afterwards connected them with roads and forts into a system called the Epikrateia.\n\nThe Epikrateia stands strong against the Greeks in the East, but it has been challenged many times over the years. The powerful city of Syracuse, led by its cruel tyrants Gelon, Hieron, Dionysios and others - those cursed scourges of Sicily - have brought chaos into the Epikrateia time and again. But protected by the mighty Senate of Carthage and the great power of the gods above, Melquart be praised, the Epikrateia has survived and remains a constant source of precious revenue for our Republic. Then, 270 years ago, we defeated the brazen Greeks off the coast of Corsica at the battle of Alalia (540 BC). Once the Greeks had retreated, we began to colonise the island, as well as its larger southern neighbour Sardinia, in full. A number of ancient Phoenician towns such as Nora had existed there before (since the 9th century BC) and since that time three centuries ago we built up a fine infrastructure even Baal-Hammon is surely proud of. The native Nuraghic (Sardinia) and Torrean people (Corsica) were satisfied as long as we kept to the coasts. But the vast plains of Sardinia offered fertile ground, surely a present by Tanit, and today Sardinian bread is always popular among the urban population of Carthage.\n\nOur expansion also incorporated other Phoenician colonies like Gades near the Pillars of Melquart. Since Phoenician curiosity is as insatiable as our shrewdness is boundless, famous sailors also explored the lands on the edge of the world. The great Hanno discovered fire-breathing mountains in the South, down the endless coast of Africa, while Himilko travelled to the North to find a land where air and water amalgamate. Carthage thrived economically and we began to dominate the Western Mediterranean. But just four decades ago (310 BC), our hegemony was challenged again by Syracuse. After a lengthy war, the gods bestowed the fortune upon us to besiege Syracuse. However, the sly Agathokles, our greatest foe and tyrant of Syracuse, shocked all Carthage when he landed a force in Africa itself. After landing at Cape Bon, he captured two of our towns and crushed our civic army - Baal-Ammon may be merciful to them! To gain the favour of the gods we made luxurious presents to Tyros, and the following year our glorious leader Hamilkar stormed the fortress of Syracuse. But once again, the false Greek gods had deceived us and Hamilkar died in the attack, losing his army and the hopes of Baal-Ammon's people. A great weeping and praying took place, and to make matters even worse, the Ptolemaic Greeks in Egypt sent reinforcements to Agathokles (308 BC). We were looking at the end of our proud civilisation...\n\nBut one year later, the gods finally answered our calls and Agathokles himself returned to Sicily, leaving his son Archagathos behind in charge of the Greek warriors in Africa. With our new forces, animated by the spirit of Baal-Qarnaim, we celebrated two impressive victories over the foreigners and saved our home. Shortly after these events (306 BC), we signed a splendid peace with the Greeks of Syracuse. While our city and land recovered quickly thanks to the many talents of our people, Agathokles proclaimed himself king like his Greek equals in the East, emulating their hero Alexander who had destroyed the Persian Empire and brought our native Phoenicia under the sway of the Hellenes. Eshmun smiled upon us when Agathokles died nineteen years ago (289 BC), and the threat of another invasion faded.\n\nWe thought we would finally live in peace, but not even a decade later, Pyrrhos of the Molossians invaded the Epikrateia. We were pushed back against the wall once more, despair arose amongst our ranks again and we had to trust on the gods to save us again. Lilybaion, however, was too strong for the Greeks once again and Pyrrhos was forced to eventually retreat back to Italy. We have become used to these invasions, but with Melquart's strength on our side we will always survive! \n\nBut we need to be wary of the power of Syracuse. The restless Greeks of this magnificent city will never stop their attacks against us, and with Hiero the Younger, yet another tyrant has risen to their throne. The Senate shall therefore support those Greeks on Sicily who are enemies of Syracuse at all times to keep the Greeks apart, and these people really only need little reason to be split and fight against each other. In the northeast, the Campanian mercenaries who call themselves the Mamertines have seized the town of Messana, and across the strait, our former allies, the Romans, might become a threat in the near future. However, the Gold of Carthage is it at your disposal, and with the blessing of Baal-Ammon, we shall retain our position as the foremost power in the Western Mediterranean!";

"Rome.Override.IMPERIAL_CAMPAIGN_SELEUCID_DESCR"                           = "\"Fortune favours the bold.\" – Simonides of Keos\n\nRoughly two decades before the battle of Chaironeia, a noblewoman called Laodike gave birth to her son in the small town Oropos in Macedonia. These days, one can hear the stories that Apollo himself, the god of music and the sun, was the true father of this child. But officially it was the son of Antiochos, a man of the army who hailed from the mountain area of Orestis. That boy was named Seleukos, and with his parents holding close relations to the royal court, he enjoyed a formidable education. Once Seleukos became a teenager, he served as a squire to king Philip II, and upon becoming a man, joined the new royal battle guard, the Hypaspists. After the battle of Chaironeia and the murder of Philip, the Hypaspists accompanied the demigod Alexander on his brave and magnificent adventures in the East. The red-haired hero brought down the empire of Persia, and the Hypaspists followed him through the endless deserts into India. Seleukos emerged not only as an impressive soldier, but also proved his abilities to command and organise. Thus, it was no surprise when the godly Alexander elected him for his elite Companions, the Hetairoi. At the battle on the river called Hydaspes in the mythical land of India, Seleukos commanded part of the right wing of the army and defeated the enemy's monstrous elephants.\n\nUpon their return to Susa, Seleukos married Apame, a woman whose beauty grandly excelled that of her native Sogdia, a rocky badland in the wild northeast. Apame gave birth to Antiochos, the first and most beloved son of Seleukos. It was at this time that the gods on Olympus felt that Alexander had done enough in the world of the mortals, and he died in the palace of Babylon. A most ambitious and very Greek competition between his generals emerged, and Seleukos took part in the early Diadoch wars on the side of the royal regent Perdikkas, but later found an esteemed friend in Ptolemaios, who had become the pharaoh of Egypt. Together they put up a fierce resistance against the mighty Antigonos Monophtalmos, who only had one eye, but the ambition to rule the whole world. They defeated his young son Demetrios at Gaza in 312 BC and Ptolemaios sent his friend eastwards, to reclaim his rule over Babylon. Accompanied by only a small contingent of elite soldiers, Seleukos was joyfully welcomed in that ancient city, and it was then that he laid the foundation for his own empire.\n\nWhen Antigonos heard of these events, he was furious and started a war against Babylon the following year. But the courageous Seleukos refused to give in and repelled the attacks of the One-Eyed time and again. After his victory, Seleukos advanced eastwards and was acclaimed as the new ruler of these Eastern people, also signing a worthy treaty with Sandrokottos (whom his own people call Chandragupta), the lord of the Indians. The brilliant Seleukos gave him empty deserts in return for 500 terrible war elephants. With those, he strengthened his army and then returned to the West, where he joined Ptolemaios and Lysimachos at the battle of Ipsos in 302 BC. In this heroic engagement, his elephants held off Demetrios Poliorketes' famed cavalry and Antigonos was finally killed. While Demetrios became a refugee and Seleukos was able to annex wide parts of Asia Minor and northern Phoenicia into his dominion, sadly a quarrel emerged between him and his friend, the Pharaoh. Both men, with only the best intentions, laid claim on the strategically important land of Koile Syria. For now, they settled their conflict peacefully, but that did not solve the problem in the long term.\n\nIn 286 BC he captured Demetrios and turned on Lysimachos, his last remaining foe, who ruled over his own little empire in Thrace. While Seleukos assembled his troops, rather cheerless news arrived from Alexandria, where the great Ptolemaois had died. His son Ptolemaios II succeeded him as Pharaoh, but his elder son Ptolemaios Keraunos was expelled. Upon arriving in Asia Minor, Seleukos decided to take Keraunos with him, thereby establishing a rather disturbed relationship with Ptolemaios II. The Seleucid Army met Lysimachos in battle at Kouroupedion in 281 BC, and both kings, who had campaigned from Macedon to India and back, and then fought endless further wars over the decades, rode into battle as old men. Seleukos won a decisive victory and Lysimachos paid with his life, which ended after 80 exhausting years. Seleukos now only had one last dream: to return to his native Macedon and hopefully unite it with his empire in the East. But when Keraunos realised what the price was, he betrayed him. The murder of Seleukos, who died, 77 years of age, after having done and achieved more in his life than most men could ever dream of, sent shockwaves through the Hellenistic world.\n\nHis son Antiochos thus faced a more than formidable challenge to keep the empire together when he inherited the kingship. Revolts broke out in Syria and Asia Minor; Bithynia and Cappadocia asserted their independence and Keraunos ruled in Macedon. To make bad matters worse, the Gauls ravaged Greece and the Bithynian dastard king invited them into Asia. Not fearing the ferocious Barbarians, Antiochos rode into battle and trampled the Celts with his mighty elephants. Seeing his rival king busy in the North, Ptolemaios II seized the chance and betrayed the old friendship of their fathers to invade Koile Syria only a few months after the Elephant Battle. Bold campaigns from both sides eventually failed, and a year ago Antiochos had to settle for peace with his most powerful foe. Now Damascus and the adjacent regions have fallen into the hands of our enemies, Cappadocia and Bithynia had to be forfeited and the Galatians have settled in central Anatolia.\n\nBut Antiochos possesses the greatest kingdom in the known world, and an army made up of the finest Macedonian and Greek soldiers, including the Hetairoi and Hypaspists, but also a vast reserve of native warriors and - of course! - the great herd of elephants who carried the day against the Galatians five years ago. His son has just come of age, the merchants of Antiocheia often travel far into the lands of India to bring the finest luxuries of the world to the court, and Antigonos Gonatas, a friend of Antiochos and rival to Ptolemaios II, now rules as king of Macedonia. The gods still hold a bright future for the Seleucid dynasty, but Antiochos must be wary of his enemies, internal as well as external, and wait for the right moment to strike and reclaim the lost lands in Syria and Asia Minor. May he be guided by Zeus to victory!";

"Rome.Override.IMPERIAL_CAMPAIGN_ARMENIA_DESCR"                            = "\"Such, then, is Armenia, almost all parts being mountainous and rugged, except the few which verge toward Media.\" – Strabo of Amaseia\n\nWe are the people of Armenia. Our country has always lain in between the great powers and thus we often had to assert ourselves in the struggles with our neighbours. Whether it was the invasions of the Hittites or the Cimmerians in the most ancient times or the attacks of the mighty Assyrians, our lands were always the target of foreign powers. Only the Persians brought tranquillity and stability into this region through their tolerant policies, but these were lost again with the destruction of their empire through the bold attack of a young conqueror from the west. Although the foreign warriors passed Armenia, the effects of their campaign were felt here only too soon after Alexander's victory over the Persian king Darius at the Battle of Gaugamela.\n\nThe Satrap Orontes commanded the divisions of our country in this battle and his fate hung in the balance for a long time thereafter. Alexander and his successors appointed other men to be satraps of Armenia, but they never really prevailed. Armenia remained a bastion of freedom against the strict Macedonian rulers. After the surprisingly early death of their great king, violent war for control of the empire broke out between the Macedonian generals. In its course, Orontes was again appointed as our Lord by the agreement of Triparadeisos and was able to build up a secure rule. Following the death of the last Successor, Seleukos Nikator, many years later, several peoples on the edges of the empire rose against his son and successor Antiochos. Our King Orontes III freed himself of the Syrian chains and since then has devoted himself to the expansion of his power against the enemies from the south and to the consolidation of his position among the powerful nobility of the country.\n\nFed by the two great rivers, the Euphrates and the Tigris, the cultivation of grain is the most important commodity in our country. Every year, on many plains and high valleys, we harvest large quantities of grain and can supply even more remote regions. The wine and even the fig grow in sheltered places in the plains. There, horses are grazing, who are indispensable for warfare in the wide plains and the high mountains. Our warriors skilfully use the bow to destroy the enemy from afar whenever it's possible. Volley after volley hits our foes, with a devastating effect on their will to fight - since no one can catch our nimble horse archers. And when the enemy is eventually shaken and losing hope, then, oh then, our iron-clad cataphract riders will dash out of the ranks and smash his army. In the fight against the phalanxes of the Macedonian conquerors, they are the best weapon at our disposal.\n\nKing Orontes III has a settled empire under his rule and could extend it to the south to the rich Babylonia or to the distant shores of the Mediterranean Sea in Syria. The Seleucids are the main opponents of such an expansion. But even the smaller kingdoms such as Pontus in the West or the emerging Parthians in the East are further competitors in the struggle for power in the former empire of Alexander the Great. Our king must be wise to decide the moment of attack... since we Armenians have done well to hide in the mountains and survive for centuries. Our country will always lie at the heart of the world, but only the Gods know who will rule it...";

"Rome.Override.IMPERIAL_CAMPAIGN_PONTUS_DESCR"                             = "\"The greater the difficulty, the more the glory in surmounting it.\" – Epicurus\n\nWe are the Kingdom of Pontos. We have come from the shadows, from the chaos, from the remnants of the empires of the Achaemenids and of the demigod Alexander. We are the Mithridatic dynasty, blessed by the gods on Olympos, who bestowed the lands on both sides of the Pontic Alps to us. The first Mithridates was given rule over the Greek city Kios by the Great King, the King of Kings Ŗtachschaçā II, who was known as Artaxerxes II in the West. His son Ariobarzenes reached the rank of a royal satrap of the grand area that is known as Phrygia. But he was struck by Hybris and rebelled against the heavenly king, allying himself with the sly Athenians. For this he was righteously killed by his son, Mithridates II of Kios.\n\nThis second Mithridates was a brilliant exponent of our dynasty. When Alexander the Great came to the East, guided by Zeus himself, to destroy the Achaemenid Empire to punish the Persians for their neglect of Ahura Mazda in recent years, Mithridates' rule survived. This clever man realised that he had to align himself with the mighty Antigonos Monophtalmos once the time had come. But even honest men can fall prey to destiny, and that is what happened to him as well. Cassander, the treacherous enemy of Antigonos, created the impression that Mithridates wanted to join his side and betray Antigonos. Despite Mithridates' desperate pleas, Antigonos decided to kill him and set after his son, who was also called Mithridates. The dynasty was in danger of being wiped out, but Demetrios Poliorketes, the son of Antigonos, warned the younger Mithridates in time to flee eastwards. Together with six loyal retainers, Mithridates rode through the mountains to the hill fortress of Kimiata. It was there where the history of the Dominion of Pontos started, and Mithridates became Mithridates I Ktistes ('the Founder') of Pontos.\n\nStarting from Paphlagonian Kimiata, Mithridates reached Amaseia in Cappadocia. The gods of the West and the East had equipped him with multiple impressive talents and skills, and the Founder quickly gathered local troops and magistrates around himself. He gradually built up a rule over the Pontic Alps region, gloriously defeated the general Diodorus just before the Battle of Kouroupedion and crowned himself king to establish the Kingdom of Pontos. In the following year his son, prince Ariobarzanes, captured the city of Amastris on our western border, an important port on the Friendly Sea. Our Kingdom had now secured a stable revenue, thanks to the ingenuity of our praised dynasty. However, after the battle of Kouroupedion, the new king of the Asian empire, Antiochos, had sent Aphrodisias to become satrap of Phrygia. This Aphrodisias threatened the Greek city Herakleia Pontika, which was already in a war with the Bithynians. The Herakliots thus came to our wise king to seek for help and had to allow us to keep Amastris when Mithridates answered their call in the times of need. This is how the Northern League was formed, and soon Nikomedes I became new king of Bithynia and joined our alliance together with Byzantium.\n\nIt was at this time that the Galatians were on their way to Asia and laid siege to Byzantium. The Herakliteans and Bithynians sent help, but the mighty Nikomedes thought it wise to hire the Galatians for his purposes and the trouser wearing Barbarians became allies of our league. They soon proved their worth, when the grand king Ptolemaios II sent his forces to Phrygia and made war on our kingdom. He had been a benefactor of the league before, but soon betrayed us and started a great war against Antiochos in Syria. Our men fought valiantly and with the help of the Celts, the enemies were driven into the sea! The Galatians, however, are unreliable allies as well and nothing can stop them to plunder and pillage the land. Ptolemaios has now concluded his war against Antiochos, but we must decide where our future will lie. Can we manoeuvre between these empires, shall we remain in the Northern League with Bitythnia, Chalcedon, Herakleia and Byzantium? A war might come, and the heir apparent Ariobarzanes is eager to prove his worth, now that his father has become old. We can rely on the Citizen Hoplites recruited from the Greek cities under our sway and the troops based on the old Persian army to defend our borders. But we should be open to anything the future might hold, open for new alliances and new possibilities...";

In the second consulship of Gaius Marius (104 BC) the four quadrupeds were laid aside as standards, the eagle (Aquila) being alone retained. It was made of silver, or bronze, with outstretched wings, but was probably of a small size, since a standard-bearer (signifer) under Julius Caesar is said in circumstances of danger to have wrenched the eagle from its staff and concealed it in the folds of his girdle.\n\nThere are two distinct and perhaps very plausible explanations of the term Antesignani. One is that they were the soldiers who were placed before the standards, formed the first line and were distinguished from the second and third lines and were not Velites. The term itself was retained long after the Hastati, Principes and Triarii had disappeared. The second was that antesignani were another elite corps picked from the bravest legionaries and employed in a variety of roles including light infantry skirmishing as well as spearheading assaults, similar to the lanciarii of later Imperial legions. They are lightly armoured, but these are legionaries, so are capable melee fighters. Their primary role is that of skirmishing with javelins, relying on their speed and large oval shields (similar to those used by the auxilia) to keep them safe.";

"Rome.Override.merc_barbarian_infantry_descr"                              = "\n\nThe Celts were excellent swordsmen and feared throughout Europe and the Mediterranean; they were at the forefront of any Celtic army and widely found as mercenaries. The Celts were \"… madly fond of war, high spirited and quick to battle…\" (Strabo, Geog., 4.4.2).\n\nThe Celtic Swordsmen were the warriors of the Celtic tribe and seasoned fighters, equipped with a long, slashing sword, shield and two spears. The sword was the primary weapon, 55-65 cm long, and Celtic swords were known for their strength and flexibility. The spears were thrown, prior to engaging with the sword, with long, broad spearheads. The characteristic Celtic shield was oval, of leather-covered wood.\n\nThe Celtic swordsmen wore a simple round-capped helmet of the Coolus type, used from the 3rd century to the 1st, and the ancestor of a school of Roman helmets. The woollen clothing of the Celts included tunic and trousers, woven and embroidered in striped and checked patterns, and brightly coloured. Celts were famed for being taller than the peoples of the Mediterranean, muscular, fair-skinned and fair-haired. Most men wear flowing moustaches and short beards.\n\nKnown as \"the Keltoi\" or the \"Galatae\" by the Greeks, and \"Celtae\" or \"Galli\" by the Romans - they were one of the great barbarian peoples of Europe. Celtic tribes were found stretching from the Iberian Peninsula to the upper Danube, and in 279-76 some Celtic tribes settled in the Balkans (Scordisci) and even Asia-Minor (Galatians).\n\nIn the middle of the fifth century BC the Celts came to be dominated by the so-called \"La Tene\" culture. With its epicentre in the middle Rhineland and the regions north of the Alps, the La Tene culture was typified by a warrior dominated social system and a common material culture, with active trade connections with both the Greek colonists of the Golfe du Lion (esp. Massalia) and the Etruscans of northern Italy.\n\nIn c. 400 BC tribes of La Tene Celts migrated into the Po Valley, overran the Etruscans there, and the Boii, Insubres and Cenomani permanently settled northern Italy; at this same time La Tene populations spread east, through the Danube corridor, settling Bohemia and the middle Danube. In c. 390 a Celtic horde sacked Rome itself, an event that left an indelible mark on the Roman folk memory. La Tene influences were also transmitted into the Iberian Peninsula, and are found among the Celtiberians there.\n\nCeltic society was made up of extended families or clans, that grouped together to form territorially-based tribes. These were ruled by a king or high chief, although by the middle of the first century BC some of the more urban Celtic tribes in the Rhone Valley had come to be ruled by elected magistrates.\n\nTribes were dominated by councils of elders and popular assemblies of all the free men of a tribe. Cattle thieving, slave raiding and vendettas ensured a constant level of low intensity warfare between Celtic clans and tribes. These warriors were bound by obligations of patronage and deference to individual chieftains, and their status was defined by their relationship with these chieftains, together with their own prowess and honour.\n\nThese Celtic warriors were commonly found throughout the Mediterranean as mercenaries. They were recruited from the fifth century by Carthage for its war in Sicily, a practice that continued during the First Punic War (264-241). Hannibal depended upon Celtic warriors in the Second Punic War (218-202). From 385 Celtic mercenaries also appear in Sicily in the armies of Dionysius I; in 367 one band of Celtic mercenaries was transported to Greece for service in the war between Sparta and Thebes.\n\nCeltic mercenaries were widely used by the Successor Kingdoms too. Bands of warriors willing to fight were available for employment and were seen as useful complements to the fighting force of aspiring tyrants. Mercenary service was an outlet for Celtic warriors to seek fame and fortune among the Mediterranean civilisations, and return home with reputations made.\n\nThere was a strong heroic ethos in Celtic society, and warriors favoured gaining honour in conspicuous ways, particularly single combat. Diodorus Siculus describes how Celtic champions offered to fight single combats \"... and when someone accepts their challenge to battle, they proudly recite the deeds of valour of their ancestors and proclaim their own valorous quality, at the same time abusing and making little of their opponent and generally attempting to rob him beforehand of his fighting spirit\" (Diod. 5.29).\n\nThe Celts were head-hunters, and victorious warriors severed the heads of their enemies to keep as trophies, a gory custom that terrified their enemies. The ambush of Postumius in 216 BC resulted in his head being made into a gilded drinking cup for sacred occasions (Livy, 23.24). The Scordisci also used heads as drinking cups (Ammianus 17.4.4).\n\nPrior to battle the Celtic warriors would work themselves into a battle frenzy, chanting and war-dancing (Diod. 5.31.1; Livy, 38.21), making noise with distinctive horns and trumpets (Diod. 5.30.5; Livy, 21.28). Finally, the Celtic army delivered a ferocious mass charge; if this charge failed to break through the enemy line, its momentum typically weakened. In general, Celtic tactics favoured battle in open country. The Swordsmen fought defensively in close formations, often with overlapping shields, while in attack the formation loosens up in a wild charge.";

Their war gear of spears and shields is the very finest that can be provided.\n\nThey are best used to break weakened enemy formations, fight against other cavalry and pursue fleeing enemies.

"Rome.Override.merc_elephants_descr"                                       = "\n\nAlthough the first elephants were tamed as early as 2500 BC, they were first used for warfare around 1000-800 BC in India. At first, they were used for logistical purposes, such as carrying heavy loads. But their battle prowess was quickly discovered, and they became the elite unit of most of the eastern kingdoms, especially in India.\nThe first contact between these beasts and a European army was in 331 BC, at Gaugamela. The Macedonian forces of Alexander the Great managed to defeat the Persian army lead by Darius III, and the elephants made a great impression on Alexander, who would gradually incorporate them in his army. When the Macedonian empire, which stretched from Greece to India, was divided between Alexander's generals after his death, the use of elephants was deeply rooted in their military strategies, especially in the Asian part of the empire: the Hellenistic kingdoms of Seleucia and Ptolemaic Egypt.\nThe elephants were used as very heavy cavalry, which they are indeed with an Indian elephant weighing around 5 tonnes. They charged straight into the enemy lines, disrupting formations, trampling soldiers to death; in other words, wreaking havoc and death. Although being crushed by a five-tonne monster is not really the funniest thing on earth, the main weapon of the elephants was not their impressive body, but the terror they brought to an entire army. Few soldiers can stand being charged at about 40km/h by a dozen elephants, and their smell panicked the cavalry.\nThere are nowadays two main species of elephant around the world (but there are of course many subspecies): the Asian and the African elephants. In the Antiquity there was a third species, the North-African Forest Elephant. It is extinct since the 2nd century BC, due to overuse in war, and for entertainment.\nThe Seleucid Empire had access to the Indian elephants, but their main foe, the Ptolemaic Kingdom hadn't. In order to cover this weakness, they needed another species; the closest to them was the North-African Forest Elephant, which lived, as his name implied, along the northern coast of Africa. They were smaller and lighter than their Asian counterpart (2m50 against 3m50), but they were the only one available; the Plain African Elephant living too far away, and being much harder to train for war. Most of them were too small to carry a tower on their back like the Asian Elephants, but it seems that some were big enough to carry a small tower. The others were ridden like a horse, with the driver, the mahout, standing with his legs around the neck. There were additionally one or two other soldiers, either on the back or in the turret (howdah) with sarissas and/or bows.\nThese towered forest elephants were then use by Pyrrhus of Epirus. The ones he used in his Italian invasion were loaned from the Egyptians, and they were the main tool of the defeat of the Romans at the battle of Heraclea in 280 BC. The Roman army, which had never faced elephants before, was quickly routed. But this was the first and last time they would face elephants unprepared. At the battle of Asculum, in 279 BC, the Roman used fire-throwing devices, ox-ridden spiked chariots... They still lost, but the elephants were far less efficient than in the previous battle.\nBut the most renowned user of towered forest elephants is without a doubt Hannibal during the Second Punic War. This Carthaginian general who dared to attack Rome in 218 BC by travelling from Spain to Italy, crossing the Alps in the meantime, had around 40 elephants. But he lost almost all of them in the crossing, and the few he had left were killed at Trebia. He then used other elephants in 202 BC at Zama, but due to Roman tactics, they caused almost as much damage to Hannibal's troops than to the Roman ones. This is the paradox of the Carthaginians: they fielded a lot of elephants, mostly Forest elephants, and they are known for it, but they almost never used them decisively, so most of the time they were more a dead weight than the key to victory.\nOther known nations who used Forest elephants, and in particular some towered ones, were the Numidians and the Kushites. This evidence can be seen on some coins made during Juba's II reign, a Numidian king. Due to its extinction, no other Forest elephants were used later in the war, especially by the Romans who had to import Asian elephants from India.";
"Rome.Override.cretan_archers_descr"                                       = "\n\nBy far the most famous of Greek archers, the Cretan Archers are renowned throughout Greece and the Eastern Mediterranean. With their composite bows, they outrange most other archers, and due to their experience and skills learned from childhood they are some of the best bowmen of the ancient world. In this period, the Hellenistic era, they were protected by light Linothorakes with Pteryges, bronze helmets or Petasos hats, boots, as well as small round Pelte shields. Should these Cretan Archers be forced into a melee, they can defend themselves with curved Machaira swords.\n\nOn the battlefield, they are most efficient when attacking unarmoured enemy units or shooting from an elevated position, while their equipment even allows them to fend off the enemy’s light units in melee.\n\nHISTORICAL BACKGROUND\n\nCretans had a dubious reputation in the ancient world. Their military virtue was not doubted: Polybios even claims they introduced the salpinx, the bugle, into Greek warfare (Polyb. IV, 20, 6). However, he indirectly contrasts their skills as skirmishers with the bravery of the Greek Hoplite: “The Cretans both by land and sea are irresistible in ambuscades, forays, tricks played on the enemy, night attacks, and all petty operations which require fraud, but they are cowardly and down-hearted in the massed face-to-face charge of an open battle” (Polyb. IV, 8, 12). Worse, on the grounds of the endemic warfare on the island and their activity as pirates, he dismisses the value of their political organisations: “So much in fact do sordid love of gain and lust for wealth prevail among them, that the Cretans are the only people in the world in whose eyes no gain is disgraceful” (Polyb. IV, 46, 3).\n\nThe constant fighting among the Cretans themselves was one of the key reasons for the ubiquity of Cretan archers as mercenaries. They were trained with the bow from childhood and often had to fight their neighbours, while at the same time the common destruction of crops and towns meant that mercenary service abroad appeared as an attractive alternative to staying on the island. Cretan cities even encouraged the recruitment of their people as mercenaries overseas, signing treaties with foreign rulers, e.g. the Antigonids, to facilitate the activities of mercenary recruiters (Chaniotis, Die Verträge, 1996; Polyb. XXIX, 10, 6 implies a similar treaty between Rhodes and the Cretan cities). They appear in the service of all major Hellenistic kingdoms. Aside from Macedon (Besides the treaties: Polyb. III, 66, 6; IV, 67, 6), the Ptolemies (Polyb. V, 36, 4; 65, 7; XXXI, 17, 8) and the Seleucids (V, 97, 10; VIII, 15, 4; X, 29, 6) often used them. Other Greek states also paid for them, e.g. Syracuse (Liv. XXIV, 30, 13; Polyb. III, 75, 7), the Achaian League (Polyb. IV, 55, 5; XXXIII, 16, 6) or the Aitolian League (Polyb. V, 14, 1-3). In Sparta they were hired by the tyrant or king Nabis (r. 207-192 BC) (Polyb. XIII, 6, 8; 8, 2), but a small contingent had already been employed in the preceding years (IV, 80, 6). Finally, the Roman Republic (Liv. XXIV, 30, 13; Polyb. III, 75, 7) had a permanent force of Cretan mercenaries under arms (Keppie, Army and Navy (1996), p. 373).\n\nOn a Hellenistic grave relief from the White Mountains of Crete, archers are shown wearing white chiton tunics and headbands. As mercenaries, however, they probably wore bronze Pilos helmets and Petasos hats on their heads as well as Linothorakes over their clothes. This is also depicted for the Greek bowmen on the 4th century Nereid Monument from Xanthos in Lycia, which is presently held by the British Museum (Mausolos of Mylasa: ‘surprise, surprise’). Additional protection in skirmishing or melee was afforded by the Peltai. These small, round bronze or bronze-covered shields were a distinctive feature of the Cretan Archers (Xen. An. 5.2.29-30). They were strapped to the forearm so as to enable both arms to be free to work the bow. Cretans used the composite bow, a bow of a \\"Scythian\\" type, able to fire quickly and powerfully. Arrows were made of wood, and the arrowheads were large and heavy, with 4.25 inch bronze heads, often barbed or hooked (Du Plessis, Seleucid Army (2022), fig. 31). On the campaign of the 10,000 in the Persian Empire, they picked up the reed arrows of the Persians to shoot further, but the superior power of the heavier wooden arrows would usually have been preferred (Xen. An. 3.4.17). On their feet they wore either standard Greek military boots or the so called Endromis shoes that were laced over a broad tongue at the front and can be seen on many contemporary vases.\n\nCretan archers were popular mercenaries throughout antiquity and beyond. They are still attested in Venetian armies of the 15th century AD (Bartusis, Late Byzantine Army (1997), p. 152). Their exceptional skills were matched by few other ancient bowmen (e.g., Persian archers) and they were therefore a valuable addition to any army.";
